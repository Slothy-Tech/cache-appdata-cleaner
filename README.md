<h2>üõ†Ô∏è How to Use Simple PC Cleaner: Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Getting started with Simple PC Cleaner is straightforward. Follow these clear steps to <strong>delete temporary files</strong> and <strong>optimize your PC</strong>:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Obtain the Script</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Copy the script code provided in this project.</li>
  <li>Save it as a file with a <code>.cmd</code> extension, e.g., <code>SimplePCCleaner.cmd</code>, using a text editor like Notepad.</li>
  <li>Place it in a convenient location, such as your Desktop or Downloads folder.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Run the Script as Administrator</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the <code>SimplePCCleaner.cmd</code> file.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>"Run as administrator"</strong> from the context menu.</li>
  <li><em>Why? Running as admin ensures the script has permission to delete files in protected system folders like <code>C:\Windows\Temp</code>.</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Navigate the Menu</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Once launched, the script displays a menu like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre>

Please choose what to clear:
1. Windows Temp Folder
2. User Temp Folder
3. Chrome Cache
4. Firefox Cache
5. Edge Cache
6. Recycle Bin
7. All of the above
8. Exit
Enter your choice (1-8):
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Type a number between <strong>1 and 8</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> to select an option:</li>
  <li><strong>1-6</strong>: Clean individual areas (e.g., <code>1</code> clears the Windows Temp folder).</li>
  <li><strong>7</strong>: Perform a full cleanup of all listed areas.</li>
  <li><strong>8</strong>: Exit the script.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Let the Cleanup Begin</h3>
<ul>
  <li>After selecting an option, the script will silently delete the files in the chosen area(s).</li>
  <li>Once finished, it returns to the menu, allowing you to make another selection or exit by choosing <strong>8</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Interaction</h3>
<p>Here‚Äôs what it looks like in action:</p>
<pre>
Welcome to Simple PC Cleaner!
Please choose what to clear:
1. Windows Temp Folder
2. User Temp Folder
3. Chrome Cache
4. Firefox Cache
5. Edge Cache
6. Recycle Bin
7. All of the above
8. Exit
Enter your choice (1-8): 3
</pre>
<ul>

<h2>üîß Troubleshooting: Fixing Common Errors</h2>

<p>While Simple PC Cleaner is designed to be user-friendly, you might encounter issues. Here‚Äôs how to resolve them:</p>

<h3>1. Files Won‚Äôt Delete</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Some files are locked because they‚Äôre in use.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix</strong>: Close all open applications (e.g., browsers or system tools) and rerun the script. If it persists, restart your PC and try again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Script Doesn‚Äôt Run</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Lack of permissions prevents execution.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix</strong>: Right-click the script and select <strong>"Run as administrator"</strong>. This is critical for accessing system folders.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Recycle Bin Not Clearing</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem</strong>: The PowerShell command used to empty the Recycle Bin fails.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix</strong>: Ensure you‚Äôre running the script as an administrator. Without elevated privileges, this feature won‚Äôt work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Antivirus Blocks the Script</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Your antivirus flags the script as suspicious due to its file-deletion actions.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix</strong>: Add <code>SimplePCCleaner.cmd</code> to your antivirus exclusion list or temporarily disable the antivirus while running the script.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. No Changes After Running</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem</strong>: The script runs but doesn‚Äôt seem to free up space.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix</strong>: Check if the targeted folders (e.g., Temp folders or browser caches) were already empty. Use a disk space analyzer to confirm the cleanup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Usage Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Permanent Deletion</strong>: Files deleted by the script (except the Recycle Bin option) are removed permanently, not sent to the Recycle Bin. Double-check that you don‚Äôt need anything in the targeted areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Admin Privileges</strong>: Always run as administrator to avoid permission errors.</li>
  <li><strong>Backup First</strong>: While the script only targets temporary files, it‚Äôs wise to back up critical data before cleaning.</li>
</ul>
